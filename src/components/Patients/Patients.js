                Patientâ€™s who desire to receive IV anesthesia (be asleep) for their surgery must come

                your scheduled appointment. Solid foods include milk products of any kind and non-clear 
                juices like orange or pineapple
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>

              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>
                Nothing, including water, can be taken during the 2 (two) hours just before your surgery or you will not be able to receive IV anesthesia
              </Typography>
